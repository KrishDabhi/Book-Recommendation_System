## 📖 Abstract

An **end-to-end Book Recommendation System** that helps users explore and discover books tailored to their interests.

🔹 Combines **Machine Learning Algorithms (Unsupervised Learning)** with **collaborative filtering**
🔹 Generates **personalized suggestions** in real-time based on the Book-Name
🔹 Integrates a **Machine Learning Pipeline** with a **web interface** using Streamlit
🔹 Scalable design suitable for **large datasets**

This repository includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, deployment scripts, and unit tests** for seamless reproduction and extension.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrishDabhi/End-to-End-Book-Recommendation-System.git
cd End-to-End-Book-Recommendation-System
```

Create and activate conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n books python=3.12.3 -y
conda activate books
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

# Streamlit app Docker Image Deployment

## 1. Login with your AWS console and launch an EC2 instance
## 2. Run the following commands

Note: Do the port mapping to this port:- 8501

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt-get upgrade

#Install Docker

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

sudo sh get-docker.sh

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

newgrp docker
```

```bash
git clone "your-project"
```

```bash
docker build -t krishdabhi/bookapp:latest . 
```

```bash
docker images -a  
```

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8502 krishdabhi/bookapp 
```

```bash
docker ps  
```

```bash
docker stop container_id
```

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

```bash
docker login 
```

```bash
docker push krishdabhi/bookapp:latest 
```

```bash
docker rmi krishdabhi/bookapp:latest
```

```bash
docker pull krishdabhi/bookapp
```
